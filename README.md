# DDOS ATTACK 

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) is an attack that aims to make a service, server, or network inaccessible to legitimate users. This attack is carried out by flooding the target with very high internet traffic from various distributed sources. As a result, the system becomes unstable and cannot operate normally, and can even experience downtime.
